## The fun part ‚Äî Material Design! üòã
> As it is quite visible, this website's design is inspired by the Material You design language by Google ‚Äî with matching colors to rounded corners and animations. It looks like one of the most beautiful landing pages I have made ‚Äî it uses no glassmorphism yet is stunning in my opinion.

## The rough part ‚Äî Researching about the headphones¬° üéä
> All I basically knew before making this landing page was that XM4s had awesome sound and ANC, but during the lroduction of this website, I had to research about pretty much everything ‚Äî from driver size to ANC limits and capacity of battery, bluetooth version, IP ratings etc. And then finding the right images, adding them for responsive site and then finding Slack links for the pitch on #the-wishing-wall and even finding the link to my own Slack profile was something new I had to do and found some barriers along the way.
